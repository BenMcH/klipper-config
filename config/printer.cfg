[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position: 50, 50
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100, 100) where the Z homing should be

#speed: 50.0
#   Speed at which the toolhead is moved to the safe Z home
#   coordinate. The default is 50 mm/s
z_hop: 15
#   Distance (in mm) to lift the Z axis prior to homing. This is
#   applied to any homing command, even if it doesn't home the Z axis.
#   If the Z axis is already homed and the current Z position is less
#   than z_hop, then this will lift the head to a height of z_hop. If
#   the Z axis is not already homed the head is lifted by z_hop.
#   The default is to not implement Z hop.
#z_hop_speed: 15.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) at which the Z axis is lifted prior to homing. The
#   default is 15 mm/s.
#move_to_previous: False
#   When set to True, the X and Y axes are reset to their previous

             -40,200
    
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the X, Y position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.
points:350,200
       50,200
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
#   provided.
speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 10
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
# retries: 2
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
retry_tolerance: 0.3
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.
